# ProMap-Renderer

Tool to visualise Prodeus levels in 2D.

This is currently very wip, it's able to render a top down view of a Prodeus level by drawing each triangle with it's assigned colour.

## Rough road map for improvemnts:

- add map and author titles
- add grid overlay
- show nodes and node links
- add different floors of the map to better show overlapping sections

## Install Dependencies

Install node.

Then run:

`npm install`

## Run

To compile and run the map locally:
`npm run-script start`

To package a windows distributabel of the app
`npm run-script make`
